&lt;p&gt;This week on the podcast we have the incredible Sophia Iannicelli, Executive Director of the Pan Eros Foundation and the Seattle Erotic Arts Festival (SEAF). With SEAF coming up soon (April 29), many queer friends have been asking me whether SEAF was inclusive of queer folx, and while I have emphatically told them yes myself, I wanted folx to hear it directly from the director herself. In a wonderfully wide-ranging and dynamic conversation, we talk all about SEAF, eroticism, art, and consent as well as queerness. Since this episode is on the longer side, here’s a list of topics and timestamps from the interview.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beckon tells us the story of how she’s had to come out twice over the course of her life, in two very different societal contexts. Along the way, we talk about interactions with societal norms, how to create safer spaces, how coming out might be different in 2021 compared to the early 2000s, and some of Beckon’s favorite queer resources.&lt;/p&gt;
