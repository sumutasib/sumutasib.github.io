&lt;p&gt;Beckon tells us the story of how she’s had to come out twice over the course of her life, in two very different societal contexts. Along the way, we talk about interactions with societal norms, how to create safer spaces, how coming out might be different in 2021 compared to the early 2000s, and some of Beckon’s favorite queer resources.&lt;/p&gt;
