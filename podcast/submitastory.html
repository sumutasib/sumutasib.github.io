        <p>Do you have a queer story to tell, or a suggestion for a guest for the program? Please send it my way! This podcast thrives on stories - your stories - so I absolutely depend on you, my listeners, for new material.</p>

<h3 id="how-to-submit">How to Submit</h3>

<p>All submissions should be sent via <a href="mailto:sumu.tasib@gmail.com?subject=Queer Kahani Story Submission">email</a>. I can’t promise I’ll respond to every email, but I do promise to read all of them.</p>

<h3 id="submission-format">Submission Format</h3>

<p>The format is pretty open-ended, but please keep the story pitch under 500 words - you don’t need to recount the whole story, just give us the gist and let us know why you think it would appeal to our audience.</p>

<h3 id="what-kinds-of-stories-should-i-submit">What Kinds of Stories Should I Submit?</h3>

<p>All kinds of stories are welcome, so long as they are true and primarily queer in content. For example, a story about having to hide your queerness in a conservative school is right on target. A story about a job interview where there happens to be a queer character, on the other hand, isn’t really right for this podcast.</p>

<h3 id="what-if-i-have-more-of-a-topic-than-a-story">What if I Have More of a Topic than a Story?</h3>

<p>That may or may not work, depending on the topic, but I welcome your submissions in any case. For instance, if you are the author of a queer book or the owner of a queer bookstore/non-profit/etc., that will likely work fine, as we can have a lively conversation about the origins, dreams, and challenges of your project. On the other hand, if you just want to talk about genderqueerness and don’t have any specific expertise on the topic, that is less likely to work. If your expertise is personal, I’d advise you to think of a story from your life which will explain your perspective.</p>

<h3 id="do-i-have-to-recite-my-story-in-a-single-blurb">Do I Have to Recite My Story in a Single Blurb?</h3>

<p>Absolutely NOT - this is not the Moth; on this show, stories unfold through an interactive, interview format. Once I invite you to talk to me about your story, we’ll have an open-ended conversation about it, where I’ll ask you a lot of questions. I’ll then edit that conversation down into a 15-30 minute episode.</p>

<h3 id="can-i-talk-about-my-queer-bookproductservicenon-profit">Can I Talk About My Queer Book/Product/Service/Non-Profit?</h3>

<p>Absolutely! I know first hand how hard it is to find a platform, so you’re absolutely welcome to talk about your queer-oriented work. Just find an interesting story to tell about it.</p>

<h3 id="what-else-should-i-think-about">What Else Should I Think About?</h3>

<p>If I select your story, I’ll ask you to tell our audience about a queer resource that has helped you in some way - it could be a non-profit, a bookstore, or an instagram account. We’ve all struggled to find the resources to help us thrive in a world where we don’t fit the default - I want to make sure we keep passing those resources on to others.</p>

<h3 id="other-questions">Other Questions?</h3>

<p>Please reach out if you have other questions that are not answered here: <a href="mailto:sumu.tasib@gmail.com?subject=Queer Kahani Feedback">sumu.tasib@gmail.com</a>.</p>
