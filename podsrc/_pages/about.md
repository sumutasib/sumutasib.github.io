Queer Kahani is a quirky, queer podcast of bite-sized stories - happy stories, sad stories, first loves, worst loves, epiphanies, recipes, and everything in between. Episodes are available here and coming soon to Spotify and Apple Music. Story submissions and feedback are welcome by [email](mailto:sumu.tasib@gmail.com).

### The Name

'Kahani' means 'story' in Hindi, so 'Queer Kahani' is a mixed-language phrase that translates roughly to 'Queer Stories.'

### The People

Queer Kahani is hosted, produced, and developed by queer author [Sumu Tasib](https://queerkahani.com). 

### How It Works

This podcast is served from github pages, with the podcast files hosted on Backblaze B2 storage. The individual pages and XML feed are generated dynamically using Jekyll. 
The code for the site is based on [Jekyll Skeleton](https://github.com/timklapdor/jekyll-skeleton) and the [Link Rot Podcast](https://github.com/timklapdor/link-rot), both by Tim Klapdor.
