### The Queer Side of SEAF

This week on the podcast we have the incredible Sophia Iannicelli, Executive Director of the Pan Eros Foundation and the Seattle Erotic Arts Festival (SEAF). With SEAF coming up soon (April 29), many queer friends have been asking me whether SEAF was inclusive of queer folx, and while I have emphatically told them yes myself, I wanted folx to hear it directly from the director herself. In a wonderfully wide-ranging and dynamic conversation, we talk all about SEAF, eroticism, art, and consent as well as queerness. Since this episode is on the longer side, here's a list of topics and timestamps from the interview.
