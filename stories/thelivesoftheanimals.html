                            <p class=MsoNormal>“How about this place?” she said, not turning to look at him.
                            The strands of synthetic fur from her long, dark coat rippled with the gesture
                            of her arm, a shimmering on the edge of his peripheral vision. Marcus tried not
                            to stare but failed, just as he had all evening: he was entranced the way her agile
                            body moved, a feral presence dancing beneath a costume shell.</p>

                            <p class=MsoNormal>He hesitated at her question, anxious at the prospect of another
                            awkward conversation, but he recognized the stakes. Dinner had been uneventful,
                            entirely devoid of sparks, and the stroll he had proposed was not proving to be
                            any better. Perhaps it was the cold, perhaps it was the threat of rain, perhaps
                            it was the things he had said or neglected to say. In his anxious tally of the
                            evening’s progress, he had decided the date was already lost; this was a last
                            chance for redemption.</p>

                            <p class=MsoNormal>“Sure,” he said, forcing a smile. She turned towards him, as
                            if about to say something, but turned back to push open the heavy door with
                            both her arms. The bar was one of the older places in the area, reminiscent of
                            an era when people stayed downtown after work to blow off steam or meet up with
                            secret lovers. After so many rounds of endless lockdowns, though, the tall
                            buildings now hemorrhaged their occupants at precisely five o’clock, the
                            streets filling with anxious faces desperate to return to the safety of their homes.
                            The only people left in bars like this were the professional alcoholics and clueless
                            tourists, the latter group hoping to find a glimpse of nightlife within walking
                            distance of their hotels. There was, though, a bit of charm to this particular
                            place, with its vast circular bar at the center of the establishment, surrounding
                            a three-story tower of vintage wines. </p>

                            <p class=MsoNormal>“Would you like a table?” the host asked with a smile, an
                            eager young man dressed in a tailored vest and bowtie, with colors matching the
                            purple shade of the bar’s décor. </p>

                            <p class=MsoNormal>“Nah, we’ll just go for the bar,” she said, already striding
                            towards it. “This really is the best part of this place,” she continued,
                            turning to look at him now and smiling slightly again.</p>

                            <p class=MsoNormal>“It is,” he said, noticing the lightening of her mood and
                            feeling some measure of relief. They picked a pair of barstools distant from
                            the small number of other customers. “And their wine selection is incredible.”</p>

                            <p class=MsoNormal>“Obviously,” she said with a smirk, looking up at the tower
                            of bottles above them. </p>

                            <p class=MsoNormal>He smiled and was reaching for the menu when he felt
                            something soft brush against his feet. Looking down, he saw a tender snout
                            pushing its nose into his leg with gentle but insistent pressure. It turned out
                            to be the curious end of a small, speckled dog in a bright pink collar, with
                            the distinctive coloring and flattened backside of an Australian Shepherd. </p>

                            <p class=MsoNormal>“Oh, hello there!” he said, his voice rising a full octave. Sliding
                            down from his stool and crouching, he held his hand out for the dog to sniff,
                            but the animal dispensed with the formalities and pushed her soft jaw into his
                            hand.</p>

                            <p class=MsoNormal>“Well, aren’t you friendly!” he said with a laugh. He moved
                            his hand to give the dog’s head and ears a quick rub. He made an attempt to
                            return to his stool and his date, but as he started to get up, she lifted a paw
                            and held on to his forearm, looking up into his eyes. </p>

                            <p class=MsoNormal>“Oh, do you want more pets, then? Well, since you’re asking
                            so nicely,” Marcus said with a laugh. He crouched back down, and now,
                            emboldened, the little dog pushed its warm body between his legs, still smiling
                            up at him. He used both his hands to push the dog’s ears back and stroke the
                            fur down to her neck, along her back and towards her tail. She jumped up to
                            lick his face and he pulled away as soon he felt her wet tongue, laughing. “Who’s
                            a good girl?” he said, “<i>Who’s</i> a good girl?” The dog’s smile widened and her
                            happy tongue rolled out to the side.</p>

                            <p class=MsoNormal>When he looked up he noticed the host standing next to him.
                            “I’m so sorry about that,” the young man said, “she’s very friendly and just
                            has to meet everyone who comes in. I hope she didn’t shed too much on your nice
                            pants?”</p>

                            <p class=MsoNormal>“Oh no worries,” he said, getting up and back onto the
                            barstool, brushing his thighs of her fur. “She’s such a good girl!” </p>

                            <p class=MsoNormal>“Yes, she is,” the host said with a bright smile. “Her
                            name’s Luna, she followed me home one day from work, no collar or chip or
                            anything, and I’ve had her ever since.” </p>

                            <p class=MsoNormal>“Oh, she <i>chose</i> you,” Marcus said, “I love that!”</p>

                            <p class=MsoNormal>The host smiled again and led the dog back to a hidden corner
                            of the bar. Marcus’ gaze followed her as she settled into her bed and folded
                            her snout into her legs.</p>

                            <p class=MsoNormal>His date had been paying close attention to the interchange,
                            watching every expression as it moved across his face. “How interesting,” she
                            said.</p>

                            <p class=MsoNormal>“Oh?” he asked, still glowing from the brief interaction.</p>

                            <p class=MsoNormal>“I just wonder how it is for <i>them</i>, you know -- the
                            lives of the animals. To have people show them that kind of love, without any
                            sort of introduction, and then just leave, to never see them again.”</p>

                            <p class=MsoNormal>“Well, that’s just what I love about dogs,” he said.
                            “They’re pure love, you know, they’re naturally affectionate.”</p>

                            <p class=MsoNormal>“Are they? Or is that just what we tell ourselves because
                            it’s what <i>we</i> desire from them, and we don’t think about how it might
                            affect <i>them</i>.”</p>

                            <p class=MsoNormal>“Well, I don’t think so,” he said, frowning. “I think
                            they’re genuinely happy to meet strangers and feel their love.”</p>

                            <p class=MsoNormal>“And they’re just as happy to have that love taken away a
                            few minutes later?” she said, wrinkling her forehead in a skeptical smile.</p>

                            <p class=MsoNormal>“Well, no, but I don’t think they’re really thinking about
                            you all that much once you’re gone.”</p>

                            <p class=MsoNormal>“So you’re saying they have no memory of you?” she asked.</p>

                            <p class=MsoNormal>He looked off to the side, thinking. “No, that’s a fair point,
                            they do; I mean there have been dogs I know who are so happy to see me even
                            after having met me only once before.” He frowned, considering the implications
                            of what she was suggesting.</p>

                            <p class=MsoNormal>“So maybe they’re just good at letting go,” she said,
                            leaning her head to the side and circling a finger on the surface of the bar. “Or
                            better than we are, anyway,” she continued with a laugh. “And you – you’re also
                            genuinely happy to feel the love of these dogs you meet, is that correct?”</p>

                            <p class=MsoNormal>“Of course!” he said, relaxing again.</p>

                            <p class=MsoNormal>“So why is it so different with people, then?” </p>

                            <p class=MsoNormal>“Excuse me? What do you mean?” he asked, pulling his head
                            back in surprise.</p>

                            <p class=MsoNormal>“Well,” she said, turning away and twisting a lock of her
                            hair around her finger, “I can tell you like me, or at least that you’re
                            attracted to me. You’ve been staring all night – it’s not subtle.” She turned to
                            face him and smiled as he blushed. “And yet after hours of conversation you can
                            barely make eye contact with me, whereas with Luna back there you were all over
                            each other in five seconds flat, making out with tongue and everything!”</p>

                            <p class=MsoNormal>“Well, that’s different,” he said, feeling even more color
                            rushing to his face. </p>

                            <p class=MsoNormal>“Is it?” she said, looking off to the distance again. “I
                            mean, maybe it is. But then I wonder, why is that? What makes it so different?”</p>

                            <p class=MsoNormal>“Well for one, you’re a thinking being, with boundaries and
                            opinions and…”</p>

                            <p class=MsoNormal>“But don’t I need affection too?” she pouted, blinking her long
                            eyelashes in a cartoonish flirtation.</p>

                            <p class=MsoNormal>He swallowed and looked at his hands. “Sure, I mean, it’s
                            just complicated – you know how it is, you meet someone, I like you, you don’t
                            like me…”</p>

                            <p class=MsoNormal>“But I do like you,” she said, a smirk on her lips.</p>

                            <p class=MsoNormal>His mouth opened in a bewildered half smile as he looked at
                            her now, blinking three times in rapid succession. “Um, ok, well, I’m just shy,
                            I guess, and…”</p>

                            <p class=MsoNormal>“You weren’t shy with Luna, were you? You just held your
                            hand out and then when she approached you, you got right in there!”</p>

                            <p class=MsoNormal>“I… well…” he stuttered with a nervous laugh.</p>

                            <p class=MsoNormal>“Oh, I’m not trying to put you on the spot or anything,” she
                            said, smiling, and looking off into the distance again. “I’m just wondering,
                            you know, what is it that’s so different about me?”</p>

                            <p class=MsoNormal>“Sure, well you know…” he said, gesturing outwards with his
                            hand. Before he could pull it back, she dropped her chin into his palm just as
                            the dog had, looking up at him with wide open eyes.</p>

                            <p class=MsoNormal>“Is it the aggressive invitation?” she asked. “But no,” she
                            continued, frowning, “you still don’t seem to be reacting the same way, hmm.”</p>

                            <p class=MsoNormal>“Um… what are you doing…” he said, his eyes darting around
                            to see who might be watching them.</p>

                            <p class=MsoNormal>“Maybe it’s about how she put her whole body right up
                            against you,” and with a rapid motion accompanied by a whisper of synthetic fur,
                            she ducked her head and moved her whole body under and past his hand so she
                            could press herself against him, rubbing her head into his neck.</p>

                            <p class=MsoNormal>He froze for a moment longer, still looking around nervously,
                            but as the warmth of her body penetrated through him, he felt a curious sense
                            of calm radiate through his limbs. He let his arms fall around her back,
                            feeling the long fur of her jacket slide between his fingers and the smooth
                            muscles of her back stretch against his touch. She made a small sound of
                            pleasure, and closing his eyes, he guided both of his hands to smooth the hair
                            around her head, along her neck, and down her back, just as he had done with
                            Luna.</p>

                            <p class=MsoNormal>“Ahhhh,” she said, “that’s more like it. There’s just one
                            more thing.”</p>

                            <p class=MsoNormal>“What’s that?” he said, feeling himself tense up again.</p>

                            <p class=MsoNormal>“Well, aren’t you going to tell me I’m a good girl?” she
                            said, pouting again.</p>

                            <p class=MsoNormal>He laughed, relaxing further against her body. “Oh, you <i>are</i>
                            a good girl.”</p>

                            <p class=MsoNormal>Her face lit up with a smile; she closed her eyes and raised
                            her shoulders up around her neck, basking in the compliment. Then, with her
                            head still against his neck, she turned her face upwards towards him. Pressing
                            her lips against his cheek, she darted her tongue between her teeth to give his
                            face the briefest of licks, then pushed herself back to her own barstool. Marcus
                            froze in place: it had happened so fast he wasn’t quite sure whether the sudden
                            wetness was just in his imagination.</p>

                            <p class=MsoNormal>“Um, did you just, um, lick me?” he asked. </p>

                            <p class=MsoNormal>“Wow, I’ve never seen someone turn so completely red so
                            quickly,” she laughed, ignoring his question. “So, should we get that drink?” she
                            continued, turning to look down at the menu as if nothing had happened.</p>

                            <p class=MsoNormal>He reached over and put a hand on her forearm, looking her
                            fully in the eyes for the first time. “I’m thinking maybe we could go somewhere
                            else for… um… dessert… instead?”</p>

                            <p class=MsoNormal>She leaned into him briefly, closing her eyes again. “Oh, now
                            that,” she said, “might be the cutest thing you’ve said all night.” She grabbed
                            his hand and met his eyes, smiling as she saw him hold her gaze. “Let’s get out
                            of here.”</p>
