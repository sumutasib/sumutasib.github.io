                            <p class=MsoNormal>What kind of fool makes a first date for Christmas Eve? Wats
                            knew better; he <i>knew</i> he knew better even when he made the date. December
                            was the time of last-minute cancelations, with family and travel and gift-shopping
                            wreaking havoc on the schedules of lonely singles. By mid-December, the Great
                            Flakeout had begun in earnest, and a day before Christmas, you couldn’t even
                            rely on the buses to run on time. Still, the week after would have been even
                            worse.</p>
                            
                            <p class=MsoNormal>He looked at his watch again. Eight minutes past seven. Not
                            unreasonably late yet, but not a good sign. He had texted her from the bus at
                            6:45 to make sure the time still worked for her. She had said she’d arrived
                            early, but then realized she had left her ID at home. Entirely reasonable.
                            Except that to minimize the chances for a no-show, he had suggested they choose
                            a place close to where she lived. Always make it easy to say yes, he had thought
                            to himself. That meant she would have had plenty of time to go home and get
                            back by now. Again, not a good sign. He looked out towards the windows facing the
                            street, but all he could see was the dark December night and the vague
                            reflection of his own ghost in the glass. </p>
                            
                            <p class=MsoNormal>Wats scrolled through her text messages from the last day to
                            see what might have happened. Nothing too remarkable there; mostly just
                            logistics on where and when to meet. Maybe a few too many emojis, though. Had
                            he seemed overenthusiastic? He noticed that each of his texts ended with an
                            exclamation mark and sometimes two, while hers rarely ended with punctuation at
                            all. Who had first suggested meeting in person? It was him. Who had suggested
                            the date and time? Him again. Great. For a certain kind of person, avoiding the
                            discomfort of saying no outweighed the guilt of standing up a stranger. But
                            what kind of person would do that? This kind of person, apparently. Crap. That
                            said, she was still within the window for plausible lateness. He had to wait
                            until at least 7:15; otherwise, he could end up being the asshole for not
                            giving her enough time. Might as well make it an even 7:30. </p>
                            
                            <p class=MsoNormal>Wats looked around the bar. It was one of the new boutique
                            cider places – long gleaming wooden tables under handcrafted lightbulbs, stools
                            fixed to swinging joints under the supports. No table service, just a register
                            in front of a giant chalkboard with the available ciders and a long array of
                            taps. He looked back at the bartender, a Seattle classic: perfectly manicured
                            beard, a moustache with waxed tips, and a vest of dark suiting material over a
                            muted plaid shirt in blue and grey. The plaid felt like an homage to the
                            neighborhood’s working-class past of rugged fisherfolk; the facial hair and
                            vest an alignment with the nouveau style of carefully curated masculinity.
                            Bearded Vest had been pleasant enough when he rang him up; as he handed back
                            his card, Wats couldn’t help but notice the dark metal band on his finger. </p>
                            
                            <p class=MsoNormal>“Must be nice this time of year, going home to a warm
                            embrace, recounting the stories of the day,” Wats muttered to himself. </p>
                            
                            <p class=MsoNormal>He imagined what story Bearded Vest might recount about him:
                            “It’s always sad this close to the holidays. You see a few singles come in.
                            This guy told me he was waiting for a date but who would make a date for
                            Christmas Eve? He just sat there looking at his phone – honestly, I think he
                            just didn’t want to be alone.” His lover would put their arms around him, glad
                            they had found someone so sensitive yet so exquisitely groomed. Putting their
                            fingers into Bearded Vest’s large (but surprisingly soft) hands, they would
                            lead him to the warmth of their marital bed. </p>
                            
                            <p class=MsoNormal>He looked at his watch again. Half past seven. Clearly, she
                            was standing him up. But what about her text? Why would she bother saying she
                            was here and then going back for her ID? Why not just leave the text unanswered?
                            He looked through the messages they’d exchanged on the app before switching to
                            text. Yes, there was some solid flirting there, in both directions, and she had
                            seemed genuinely interested. What if she had planned to return, but something
                            happened on the way home or back? Maybe a family emergency of some kind – but
                            then she would at least have texted. But what if she couldn’t text because <i>she</i>
                            was the one with an emergency? Think about it – the streets were desolate, and
                            there were still some industrial areas in this neighborhood with sinister figures
                            lurking in the shadows. What if she had taken a shortcut to rush back to the
                            bar and then been assaulted, knocked to the cold ground while the villains took
                            her wallet – or worse. Shit. Shit. Shit.</p>
                            
                            <p class=MsoNormal>Should he go out and look for her? But he had no idea where
                            she lived. Should he call for help? But he didn’t even know her full name, just
                            her phone number. It would probably be possible to get her identity from a
                            phone number, but not without the police. He could call the police, but what
                            would he tell them? “Hey this person I met online didn’t show up for my date
                            and I’m worried something horrible has happened to her so could you please go
                            look for her?” They wouldn’t even take a Missing Person report until she’d been
                            gone for 24 hours, and even then, the story would sound ridiculous. The thought
                            of the police laughing at him began to calm him down.</p>
                            
                            <p class=MsoNormal>“But what if she really is missing?” Wats fretted, his fears
                            rekindling. “The first thing they’d do would be to check her phone records, to see
                            who the last person she communicated with was – me. I’ve been in this bar the
                            whole time, but how would they know that? My phone location data! That would
                            probably clear me. But I’ve heard phone location data isn’t that precise, so if
                            she was attacked somewhere nearby, they might still think it was me. Crap. Who
                            could testify that I was here the whole time? <i>Bearded Vest</i>! But would he
                            remember me? Probably not, he sees hundreds of people every day. I need to do
                            something to make myself memorable. Maybe I can ask him to take a selfie with
                            me – the picture alone won’t prove anything, but the awkwardness of that moment
                            would make him remember my face, then connect it to my being here the whole
                            night. Jesus, this is going to be embarrassing, but I guess it’s what I need to
                            do…”</p>
                            
                            <p class=MsoNormal>Wats sighed, turned to look at the unsuspecting bartender,
                            and felt his heartrate rise rapidly as he got up to approach him.</p>
                            
                            <p class=MsoNormal>“Wats?” a small voice asked from the other side of the
                            table. He turned back to see a smiling, oval face the color of sand, surrounded
                            by the fur fringe of an enormous puffer jacket. </p>
                            
                            <p class=MsoNormal>“Kaleena!” he said, almost shouting in his surprise.</p>
                            
                            <p class=MsoNormal>“Oh you must be soooo mad,” she said, turning her body to
                            make a quick escape but with her eyes still locked onto his. “I should probably
                            just go.” </p>
                            
                            <p class=MsoNormal>“No, no, don’t go, I’m not mad at all, just relieved! What
                            happened?” Wats made a rapid inventory of her features: dark, narrow eyes extended
                            into wings; a septum ring; a slender frame constantly in motion.</p>
                            
                            <p class=MsoNormal>“Oh, it was Edgar. My hedgehog.” Kaleena looked down but
                            raised her eyes again to smile at him. </p>
                            
                            <p class=MsoNormal>“Your hedgehog?” Wats asked in genuine surprise.</p>
                            
                            <p class=MsoNormal>“He’s kind of a little shit, actually.” She smiled and
                            briefly turned her body away and back. “When I got home, I saw his water was empty,
                            and when I opened his cage to take it out and fill it, he made a break for it.
                            Once he’s hidden away, he’s almost impossible to find, and so stupid he’ll
                            starve before giving up his little game. I had to keep eyes on him as I chased
                            him around my apartment, and it took this long just to coax him back into his
                            little house.”</p>
                            
                            <p class=MsoNormal>“Now that,” Wats laughed, “is not what I was expecting!”</p>
                            
                            <p class=MsoNormal>“Well, you said you were relieved, not angry; that’s not
                            what I was expecting either! Tell me, Wats, what were you relieved about? Did
                            you think I was going to stand you up?” </p>
                            
                            <p class=MsoNormal>“No…well, yes, actually. At first. But then I was worried
                            something dreadful had happened to you!” </p>
                            
                            <p class=MsoNormal>“Something dreadful – how dark and exciting!” she said,
                            straddling the stool in front of him and swinging it closer as she pushed back
                            the hood of her jacket. She put her elbows on the table, rested her face in her
                            upturned hands, and smiled up at him, fluttering her eyes. “Do tell – I love a
                            good true crime story.”</p>
                            
                            <p class=MsoNormal>Wats went through the entire progression of his thoughts,
                            leaving no detail unturned. He had a vague sense that he might be oversharing,
                            but she seemed to be entranced by his words. When he got to the selfie with the
                            bartender, she laughed out loud, covering her mouth with one hand while
                            reaching out to stroke his arm.</p>
                            
                            <p class=MsoNormal>“A selfie with Bearded Vest! Oh, my poor dear, you must have
                            been truly desperate. But now I kind of want you to take that selfie anyway,”
                            she said with a giggle. “That’s quite an imagination you have, mister.”</p>
                            
                            <p class=MsoNormal>“It’s just my damned anxiety,” Wats said, laughing as well,
                            beginning to wonder if this adorable creature might actually be finding him
                            interesting. “My therapist calls it <i>catastrophizing</i>. Once my brain
                            starts going, it’s really hard for me to stop.” </p>
                            
                            <p class=MsoNormal>“How interesting,” she said, squinting off to the side and
                            pausing for a long moment. “So much detail: the bartender’s spouse. The police
                            scanning my phone records. What if…”</p>
                            
                            <p class=MsoNormal>Wats squirmed. Maybe she found him “interesting” as in
                            “interesting mental patient,” not “interesting person I would want to date.” Unable
                            to hold the silence, he blurted out, “What if <i>what</i>?”</p>
                            
                            <p class=MsoNormal>“Oh!” she laughed. “What if anxiety is your superpower?”</p>
                            
                            <p class=MsoNormal>“Wait, what?” he asked, genuinely mystified.</p>
                            
                            <p class=MsoNormal>“Well, it’s your anxiety that led you to have all these
                            worries, right? Which turned into this incredibly rich story. What if the same
                            part of your brain that makes you worry so much is the part that’s able to
                            weave those tales?”</p>
                            
                            <p class=MsoNormal>“Interesting,” he said, pausing to look off to the side. “I’ve
                            never thought about it that way. I suppose you can’t really worry if you can’t come
                            up with all the terrible things that might happen, right?”</p>
                            
                            <p class=MsoNormal>“Right!” she said, smiling up at him. “Have you ever thought
                            about writing them down?”</p>
                            
                            <p class=MsoNormal>“My worries?”</p>
                            
                            <p class=MsoNormal>“Yes, well, maybe not all your worries, but at least the
                            ones that turn into stories? ‘Cause maybe,” Kaleena said, shimmying her
                            shoulders towards him in a tiny dance, “some of those stories will be about
                            me.”</p>
                            
                            <p class=MsoNormal>“Mayyybe,” he said, sharing in her smile.</p>
                            
                            <p class=MsoNormal>“Preferably ones where I’m not getting hacked to bits by
                            some ne’er-do-well.”</p>
                            
                            <p class=MsoNormal>They both laughed. They spent the next hour talking,
                            smiling, teasing, joking. At nine, Bearded Vest came over to tell them the bar
                            was closing early for the holiday. They walked outside together, their breaths merging
                            into a private fog in the still December air. </p>
                            
                            <p class=MsoNormal>“Now, I really do want to see you again, and I want to hear
                            more of your stories,” she said. “And I’m going to text you as soon as I get
                            home so you’ll know I haven’t been the victim of a horrible murder.”</p>
                            
                            <p class=MsoNormal>“I would like that,” Wats said, laughing.</p>
                            
                            <p class=MsoNormal>“Wait – you would like a text, or to see me again?” she
                            pouted.</p>
                            
                            <p class=MsoNormal>“Both,” he said, holding his arms out in an invitation. She
                            jumped into him, holding him tightly until her puffer jacket had deflated
                            against his body. Giggling, she spun around to walk briskly away, turning back once
                            to smile and wave. A good sign. He headed towards the corner, seeing the bus
                            pull up just in front of him. Another good sign. He boarded and found a pair of
                            seats to himself. Pulling out his phone, he thought back to the beginning of
                            the night, retracing his steps as he entered the bar, and began to write:</p>
                            
                            <p class=MsoNormal>“What kind of fool makes a first date for Christmas Eve?”</p>
